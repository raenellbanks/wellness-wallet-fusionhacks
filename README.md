## 🌻 Why I Built This

Hey, I’m **Raenell Banks**, a cybersecurity analyst-in-training with a passion for mixing tech with tenderness. I built Wellness Wallet for the [FusionHacks 2025 Hackathon](https://fusionhacks.devpost.com/) to create a space where wellness and digital safety collide — especially for women from underrepresented communities who deserve both empowerment and ease.
