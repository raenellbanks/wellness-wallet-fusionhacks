# Wellness Wallet 💚✨

A soulful sanctuary where mental wellness meets cybersecurity — designed for women everywhere who deserve more than just survival.
Why I built this — straight from the heart
Life moves fast, and juggling mental wellness and digital safety is a damn challenge. As a woman stepping into tech and cybersecurity, I saw that too often, wellness tools and cyber safety conversations leave out everyday women like us.

Wellness Wallet is my passion project to change the game. It’s a safe, uplifting space where all women can check in emotionally, soak up daily affirmations, learn bite-sized cyber tips, and share their thoughts anonymously — all wrapped up in a vibe that feels like home. Because every woman deserves tools that protect her peace and her data, without the confusing tech talk or coldness.

How I brought Wellness Wallet to life
Backend:
Google Sheets + Sheet.best API: Where all the mantras, mood prompts, cybersecurity tips, and anonymous messages live — easy to update without messing with code. Sheet.best bridges Google Sheets to the app with smooth API calls.

Frontend:
HTML & CSS: Clean split layouts so you’re never scrolling forever — mantras and music side-by-side, moods and emojis in a square, cyber tips paired with images. Fonts are Pacifico for that warm, welcoming header, and Merienda for easy, comfy reading.

JavaScript: Makes it interactive — rotating mantras with next buttons, play button for audio, clickable animated emojis with live voting percentages, cycling cyber tips and images, plus a light/dark mode toggle so you can vibe your way anytime.

Development:
VS Code: Where all the magic happens — writing clean, organized code.

GitHub Pages: Hosts the live project, available to all women worldwide without a hitch.

What’s inside your Wellness Wallet?
