# ✨ Wellness Wallet ✨

**A digital safe space for mind, soul, and cyber wellness – built for women of color, by a woman of color.**

Wellness Wallet is a single-page self-care web app blending daily inspiration, mood tracking, and cybersecurity tips in a soft, feminine interface. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Google Sheets (via Sheet.best), it offers rotating mantras, mood check-ins with emoji options, cyber hygiene reminders, and anonymous journaling.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

## 💡 Why This Project?

This project was created for the FusionHacks 2 Hackathon. As a Black woman in tech, I wanted to build something that prioritizes _us_ — our mental, digital, and emotional well-being. Wellness Wallet is my contribution to creating sacred, tech-empowered spaces where we can be soft, expressive, and protected — online and within.
