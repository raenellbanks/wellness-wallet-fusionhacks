# 💖 Wellness Wallet 💻🧘🏾‍♀️

Welcome to **Wellness Wallet** — a digital safe space created with love by **Raenell Banks**, a Black woman in tech who's _done surviving_ and now choosing to _thrive_.

This web app blends mindfulness with cybersecurity — two areas often left out of conversations about wellness for women of color. **Here, we honor both.**

🛠 Built for the 2025 [FusionHacks](https://fusionhacks.devpost.com/) hackathon.

## ✨ Why I Built This

I’m **Raenell Banks** — a Cybersecurity Analyst-in-training through **Merit America**, a Black woman, a music lover, a sister, an auntie, and someone who just wants to enjoy life, not barely make it through it.

Too often, women like me are expected to carry the weight of the world without spaces to **vent**, **reflect**, or **learn how to protect ourselves** in the digital space.  
I built _Wellness Wallet_ for **us** — the soft warriors.

This project gives us:

- Daily affirmations for our spirits
- A place to reflect on our moods
- A safe anonymous space to speak freely
- And real cyber hygiene tips to protect our digital peace

Because **wellness isn't just yoga mats and herbal tea** — it's emotional safety, online safety, and the space to breathe.
